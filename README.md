# 3D Game OpenGL Project

For this project, I had to create any 3D game using OpenGL in Visual Studion 2019.

For this game I just wanted to create a basic aim trainer, the player goes around shooting bullets at floating boxes in the air - some are stationery whilst some are moving around at random speeds and trajectories.

## Game Description 

### Playing the game

#### Some basic rules

You spawn in as a First Person character holding a gun, you may adjust your sensitivity to your personal preference, aim down your sights, move around with basic controls and jump. Each time you hit a box with a bullet, you get one point. As well as this, you also consume ammo when shooting and have to reload the gun - however, for simplicity I made it possible to reload an infinite amount of times.

#### The Targets

There are hundreds of small boxes hovering around in the air with random positions and random varying velocities - your goal as the player is to practice your aim on them to improve.

#### Player Info & Controls

The player can move around with WASD controls and use the space bar to jump. By moving the mouse around the player can look around, and they can also aim down their sights with a right click, and then fire their weapon with left click. The player can also Reload with the R key, and get their cursor on/off the screen with the P key.
